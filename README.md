# MovieRESTfulAPI
Basiccally, this API is a simulation of http://www.omdbapi.com/.I'm learning mongodb and Python Flask by creating this web service.

movie.txt includes all the movies info formatted in JSON
movie.py is the method to parse the movie list info which retrieved from IMDB
_get_movie.py is the method to get Movies info from http://www.omdbapi.com/ according to the movies' titles which get from movie.py
